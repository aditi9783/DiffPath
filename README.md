# DiffPath

DiffPath is a program to detect differentially expressed sub-pathways from RNAseq and pathway (in xml format, as in KEGG database) data.

Benefits of using DiffPath:
- Takes pathway structure into account (unlike GSEA)
- Can detect a broader set of differentially expressed sub-pathways (unlike SPIA that is limited to tree-like structure sub-pathways)
- Is not biased towards most significantly differentially expressed genes in a pathway (unlike DEAP)
